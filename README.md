# Gaussian Process Regression using Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling
Exact Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with non-Gaussian likelihoods using robust infinite-dimension Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling for spatial inference problems. 

The MCMC is Metropolis Hastings sampling adapted to infinite dimensions using the preconditioned Crank-Nicholson proposal step.
